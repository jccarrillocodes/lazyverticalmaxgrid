# LazyVerticalMaxGrid
Using LazyVerticalGrid or LazyGrid with items that have odd height and using weight to equalize all items in the same row doesn't have effect

## Solution
With a LazyColumn and Rows we can achieve the desired effect as you can see in the bottom part of the screenshot

## Extras
This solution wrapper items with an adapter to control visibility of the element. Using this wrapper allows to specify enter and exit animations.
